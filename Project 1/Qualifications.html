		<h3>Technical Skills</h3>
		<p>My technical skills specifically related to programming include Python, C++, Swift, SQL, and HTML/CSS. I've used Python in a multitude of extracurricular projects, and at a few of my internships. C++ and HTML/CSS are the languages used in my coursework, while SQL and Swift are langauges I've used sparingly at work and for extracurricular actities.</p>
		<p>Other, more general technical skills include Microsoft Office, design software like Figma, and Git. </p>

		<h3>Technical Areas of Interest</h3>
		<p>My technical areas of interest include: autonomous vehicles, computer vision, neural networks, sports analytics, and application development. Autonomous vehicles and a large portion of the machine learning behind it, machine learning are rapidly advancing and becoming a commonplace occurrence in everyday life. This is seen through the popularity of cars like Teslas and other car manufacturers efforts to match or surpass them.
			Similarly, with sports analytics becoming increasingly data driven, there is more than ever for a software engineer inclined towards data science to do/ contribute to the field. Application development includes both web and app development, where you're coding with HTML/CSS/Javascript or related libraries and Java/Swift for mobile apps. I've developed several apps before, and while never having the opportunity to publish them on an
			appstore due to lack of funds, I remained interested in that sector.
