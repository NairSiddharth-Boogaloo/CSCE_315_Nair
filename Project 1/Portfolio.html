		<h3>oWAR</h3>
		<p>oWAR was a project I created as an alternative attempt to predictive model baseball players' future performance. It originally was built using the Python library, Scikit as a learning exercise to familiarize me with Python + machine learning models. It combines various statistics (just like the other types of WAR) that are available freely (what made my model different) to see if there was a statistic out there that better predicted a player's future performance. The types of algorithms used were Linear, Lasso, Logistic, and Random Forest.

		<h3>Meal Maximizer</h3>
		<p> Meal Maximizer was a project Christopher Pasala and I cofounded back in 2019 as a way to see if we could track a student's remaining meal plans in a more presentable way than Texas A&M's method (which was and still is to my knowledge through a clunky website). After a few hiccups, namely some issues with trying to bypass A&M authentication & then Covid forcing us to go back to the drawing board in terms of app scope & timeline to release, we picked up speed and began to code in earnest. By the end of the first year of Covid (2019), we had a working Android app, written in a combination of Java, XML, and Figma for design. By the end of 2020, we had a semi-working iOS prototype written in Swift, SwiftUI, and Figma for the original design. Due to a lack of funds at the time, we never released it, but it remains a great first experience with project management and managing feature creep.

		<h3>Airman Stock Predictor</h3>
		<p>
			The Airman Stock Predictor came about a little more simply than the two other projects I showcase on this website as it began as a simple tool to teach me how to web scrape data from websites that admittedly may have frowned on web scraping from them. I was curious in seeing how I could keep track of stock performance without having to go to a website and thought of first attempting to web scrape something like Google Finance as that was what I used at the time for tracking investments. Unfortunately, after I learned how to web scrape using Python and the BeautifulSoup library, I learned that that website doesn't allow web scraping, so I then pivoted into using Yahoo Finance. Eventually, this resulted in me creating a very rudimentary stock tracker and predictor (that I will be honest and say doesn't really work) that attempted to use the scikit library to create an algorithm to see where the free cash flow a company had had any correlation to its current's stock price. The technologies used were Python, BeautifulSoup, Scikit, and Pytrends.
